## Huffman Coding

Huffman coding is a compression algorithm that can be used to compress lists of characters.

In a normal, uncompressed text, each character is represented by the same number of bits (usually eight). In Huffman coding, each character can have a bit representation of a different length, depending on how common a character is: the characters that appear often in a text are represented by a shorter bit sequence than those being used more rarely. Every huffman code defines the specific bit sequences used to represent each character.

A Huffman code can be represented by a binary tree whose leaves represent the characters that should be encoded. The code tree below can represent the characters A to H.

The leaf nodes have associated with them a weight which denotes the frequency of appearance of that character. In the example below, the character A has the highest weight 8, while F for example has weight 1.
Every branching node of the code tree can be thought of as a set containing the characters present in the leaves below it. The weight of a branching node is the total weight of the leaves below it


### Encoding
For a given Huffman tree, one can obtain the encoded representation of a character by traversing from the root of the tree to the leaf containing the character. Along the way, when a left branch is chosen, a 0 is added to the representation, and when a right branch is chosen, 1 is added to the representation. Thus, for the Huffman tree above, the character D is encoded as 1011.

### Decoding
Decoding also starts at the root of the tree. Given a sequence of bits to decode, we successively read the bits, and for each 0, we choose the left branch, and for each 1 we choose the right branch. When we reach a leaf, we decode the corresponding character and then start again at the root of the tree. As an example, given the Huffman tree above, the sequence of bits,10001010 corresponds to BAC.
